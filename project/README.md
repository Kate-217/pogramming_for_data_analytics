# Gas Demand Analysis in Ireland

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the daily gas demand in the Republic of Ireland. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [DATA.GOV.IE](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dailygasdemandireland). The analysis aims to explore gas consumption across different economic sectors and investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on gas demand. Various data cleaning, visualization, and forecasting techniques are used to model and predict gas demand patterns.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains daily records of gas consumption across various economic sectors in Ireland. The source of the data is [DATA.GOV.IE](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dailygasdemandireland), a platform providing open government data. 

## Project Objectives

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration**: Preparing and exploring the dataset to ensure its usability for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing gas consumption across various sectors and comparing periods, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Implementing forecasting models like SARIMA to predict future gas consumption patterns.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of forecasting models on train and test data.
