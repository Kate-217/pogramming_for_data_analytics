# Programming for Data Analytics - Assessments
## Overview

This repository contains a collection of tasks and assessments completed as part of the Programming for Data Analytics module at Atlantic Technological University. The goal of the module is to develop proficiency in programming for data analytics, covering various techniques in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python.

The assessments cover a variety of data analysis tasks, ranging from basic data cleaning to more complex visualizations and analyses using real-world datasets.

The `assignments` folder contains the **assessments** completed during the module, including a `Labs` subfolder with the **lab** exercises conducted throughout the module.

## Assessments
* Assignment 2 **Weather**<br>
The task involves creating a Jupyter notebook to visualize the temperature `dryBulbTemperature_Celsius` over time using weather data.
You can download the data using this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/refs/heads/main/assignment/weatherreadings1.csv).
* Assignment 3 **Domains - Email Domain Pie Chart**<br>
This assignment requires creating a pie chart to visualize the distribution of email domains from a given [dataset](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download).<br>
* Assignment 5 **Risk Battle Simulation**<br>
The goal of this task is to create a program that simulates 1,000 rounds of the board game Risk, featuring 3 attackers versus 2 defenders. The program should track the results of each battle, determine the winners, and produce a visualization of the outcomes.
* Assignment 6 **Knock Airport Weather.**<br>
The goal of this task is to analyze weather data from Knock Airport by calculating and visualizing various weather metrics over time. Specifically:
* Plot the temperature trends over time.
* Calculate and visualize the mean temperature for each day and each month.
* Analyze the windspeed data by:
- Plotting the windspeed over time.
- Calculating the 24-hour rolling average windspeed.
- Finding and plotting the daily maximum windspeed.
- Calculating and plotting the monthly mean of the daily maximum windspeed.

## Dataset
This project uses real-world data, including weather data from Knock Airport and other sources as outlined in each specific task. 

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are used across all tasks:
- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` - For data visualization.
- `seaborn` - For advanced statistical data visualization.
- `numpy` - For numerical computations.

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```
## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kate-217/programming_for_data_analytics.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd programming_for_data_analytics
```
3. Inside the assignments folder, you will find subdirectories for each assessment. You can navigate to each specific assessment folder to explore and run the corresponding scripts.
## Outputs
Each task will produce specific visualizations and output, including:
* Temperature trends over time.
* Daily and monthly average temperatures.
* Windspeed visualizations and rolling averages.
* Max windspeed trends and monthly averages of daily max windspeed.
The outputs for each task are displayed as plots generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
