# Programming for Data Analytics - Assessments
__________________________
## Overview

This repository contains a collection of tasks and assessments completed as part of the **Programming for Data Analytics** module. The goal of the module is to develop proficiency in programming for data analytics, covering various techniques in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python.

The assessments cover a variety of data analysis tasks, ranging from basic data cleaning to more complex visualizations and analyses using real-world datasets.

## Assessments

* Assignment 2 **Weather**
The task involves creating a Jupyter notebook to visualize the temperature `dryBulbTemperature_Celsius` over time using weather data.
* Assignment 2 **Domains - Email Domain Pie Chart**
This assignment requires creating a pie chart to visualize the distribution of email domains from a given [dataset](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download).<br>
* Assignment 5 **Risk Battle Simulation**
Goal:
Create a program that simulates 1000 rounds of the board game Risk with 3 attackers vs. 2 defenders. The program should track the results of each battle, determine winners, and produce a visualization of the results.
* Assignment 6 **Knock Airport Weather.**
The goal of this task is to analyze weather data from Knock Airport by calculating and visualizing various weather metrics over time. Specifically:
* Plot the temperature trends over time.
* Calculate and visualize the mean temperature for each day and each month.
* Analyze the windspeed data by:
- Plotting the windspeed over time.
- Calculating the 24-hour rolling average windspeed.
- Finding and plotting the daily maximum windspeed.
- Calculating and plotting the monthly mean of the daily maximum windspeed.

## Dataset

This project uses real-world data, including weather data from Knock Airport and other sources as outlined in each specific task. 

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are used across all tasks:

- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` - For data visualization.
- `seaborn` - For advanced statistical data visualization.
- `numpy` - For numerical computations.

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```
## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kate-217/programming_for_data_analytics.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd programming_for_data_analytics
```
3. Inside the assignments folder, you will find subdirectories for each assessment. You can navigate to each specific assessment folder to explore and run the corresponding scripts.
## Outputs
Each task will produce specific visualizations and output, including:
* Temperature trends over time.
* Daily and monthly average temperatures.
* Windspeed visualizations and rolling averages.
* Max windspeed trends and monthly averages of daily max windspeed.
The outputs for each task are displayed as plots generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
