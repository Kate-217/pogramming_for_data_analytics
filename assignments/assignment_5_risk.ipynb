    "## Create a Program:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should simulate 1000 individual battle rounds in the board game Risk, specifically with 3 attackers vs. 2 defenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Battle round rules: \n",
    "Each battle round involves one roll of dice for both attacker and defender. \n",
    "**The highest dice roll from each side is compared:**\n",
    "If the attacker’s roll is equal to or lower than the defender’s, *the attacker loses one troop*.\n",
    "If the attacker’s roll is higher, *the defender loses one troop*.\n",
    "**Compare Second-Highest Dice Rolls**: The same rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Plot Results: \n",
    "The program should produce a plot summarizing the results of the battle rounds. The specifics of what to plot are left to your discretion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra Challenge: Create a more complex simulation that runs until one side's army is eliminated. This simulation should handle armies of any size and plot the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program should model battle outcomes, track results, and create visualizations of the simulated rounds."
